# Operational Transconductance Amplifier Design Using Cadence Skill

This repository contains the complete design, layout, and simulation of an Operational Transconductance Amplifier (OTA) using Cadence tools. The OTA circuit was designed in the Cadence Virtuoso Schematic Editor, and the layout was created using Cadence Skill scripting. Pre-layout simulations were conducted to verify the design, and both Layout Versus Schematic (LVS) and Design Rule Check (DRC) were successfully performed on the layout.

## Project Overview
- **Schematic Design**: The OTA was designed using the Cadence Virtuoso Schematic Editor, focusing on a differential input stage with a current mirror load.
- **Layout Creation**: The layout was generated using Cadence Skill scripting, automating the placement and routing of components.
- **Pre-Layout Simulation**: Simulations were run on the schematic to ensure the circuit met the initial design specifications before layout.
- **LVS and DRC**: Layout Versus Schematic (LVS) and Design Rule Check (DRC) were successfully completed to validate the correctness and manufacturability of the layout.

## Key Features
- **Cadence Skill Automation**: The layout of the OTA was automated using custom Skill scripts.
- **Pre-Layout Validation**: Simulation results verify that the OTA design meets performance targets before layout.
- **Post-Layout Verification**: LVS and DRC checks ensure the layout's correctness and adherence to design rules.
